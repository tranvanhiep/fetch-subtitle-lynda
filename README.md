# Fetch subtitle from specific course on lynda.com
Fetch and store subtitle in local. Only if you have this course in local.

P/S: Only in my case currently.

## File name convention
`[#chapter]_[#subchapter]-[any name here].mp4`

## Issues
Actually we only fetch subtitle from free courses. There is no subtitle for paid courses.
